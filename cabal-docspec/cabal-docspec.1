\f[I][CABALFILE]\f[R]\&...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[I]cabal\-docspec\f[R] is a doctest runner closely integrated with
\f[I]cabal\-install\f[R].
In common scenarios cabal\-docspec is able to self\-configure using
cabal\-install generated metadata (\f[I]plan.json\f[R]).
Another important difference is that cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt depend on
\f[I]ghc\f[R] library, but rather invoke the \f[I]ghci\f[R] executable.
.PP
cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt use GHC to parse input files, but rather
relies on \f[I]haskell\-lexer\f[R] for comment extraction.
This approach is resilient, but not 100 per cent accurate.
.PP
cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt interpret library code in \f[I]ghci\f[R], but
instead loads precompiled code.
The effect is similar as using \f[B]\-fobject\-code\f[R] in GHCi (which
is mandatory for packages with FFI, for example).
The consequence is that cabal\-docspec is unable to evaluate doctest
examples in non\-exported modules (\f[B]other\-modules\f[R]), or which
use non\-exposed symbols.
.PP
GHCi is invoked in a package directory, however it is told to not look
for modules anywhere (with bare \f[B]\-i\f[R] flag).
This way doctests may use package local files, but the code is not
re\-intepreted.
.SH OPTIONS
In general, all boolean options are enabled with \f[B]\-\-option\f[R]
and yet again disabled with \f[B]\-\-no\-option\f[R].
That is, you use the exact same option name but prefix it with
\(lqno\-\(rq.
However, in this list we mostly only list and show the \(enoption
version of them.
.TP
\f[B]\-w, \-\-with\-compiler\f[R] \f[I]path\f[R]
A path to compiler to use to run doctest examples.
Must have the same version as in the cabal plan.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-ghc\f[R]
Indicate the used compiler is GHC.
Currently this options is no\-op.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-cabal\-plan\f[R]
Read \f[I]plan.json\f[R] produced by cabal\-install to find out project
packages and their dependencies.
When turned (with \f[B]\-\-no\-cabal\-plan\f[R]), paths to the cabal
files have to be given.
Also only the global package db is considered for dependencies.
Default \f[B]\-\-cabal\-plan\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-preserve\-it\f[R]
Preserve \f[B]it\f[R] variable, i.e.\ the result in of previous
expression.
Default \f[B]\-\-no\-preserve\-it\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-strip\-comments\f[R]
Strip Haskell comments from examples and the outputs.
Especially outputs are assumed to be Haskell\-like.
Default \f[B]\-\-no\-strip\-comments\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-Z, \-\-ignore\-trailing\-space\f[R]
Strip trailing whitespace from the produced outputs.
Default \f[B]\-\-no\-ignore\-trailing\-space\f[R].
.TP

An additional expression to execute as setup for all examples.
Can be specified multiple times.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-extra\-package\f[R] \f[I]pkgname\f[R]
An extra package to make available in GHCi session.
The package must exist in the plan.

.TP
\f[B]\-\-timeout\f[R] \f[I]seconds\f[R]
Timeout for evaluation of single expression.
Default: 3 seconds.
Long timeouts may allow GHCi to acquire a lot of resources.
On the other hand, too short timeout may cause false negatives.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-timeout\-message\f[R] \f[I]message\f[R]
Message to return when the evaluation is timed out.
Default is \f[B]* Hangs forever *\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-ghci\-rtsopts\f[R] \f[I]options\f[R]
RTS options for GHCi process
.TP
\f[B]\-\-check\-properties\f[R]
Evaluate \f[B]prop> expr x y\f[R] using \f[B]quickCheck (expr x y)\f[R].
Requires \f[I]QuickCheck\f[R] package in the plan.
Default \f[B]\-\-no\-check\-properties\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\-\-property\-variables\f[R] \f[I]varlist\f[R]
Variables to quantify over in properties.
.TP

First phase consists of discovering the modules, and extracting the
doctest examples from their comments.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-phase2\f[R]
Stop after the second phase, i.e.\ evaluation in GHCi phase.
.TP
\f[B]\-m, \-\-module\f[R] \f[I]modulename\f[R]
Check only these modules.
Default is to check all.
.TP
\f[B]\-\-builddir\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R]
Directory to look for \f[B]plan.json\f[R] and local package database.

.SH CABAL FIELDS
It\(cq is possible to provide cabal\-docspec configuration through
fields in a .cabal file.
.TP
\f[B]x\-docspec\-options:\f[R] \f[I][OPTION]\f[R]\&...
These options will be applied \f[I]before\f[R] command line options, and
allow configuration of cabal\-docspec per component under test.
.TP
\f[B]x\-docspec\-extra\-packages:\f[R] \f[I][PKG]\f[R]\&...
A (space separated) list of extra packages.
See \f[B]\-\-extra\-package\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]x\-docspec\-property\-variables:\f[R] \f[I][VAR]\f[R]\&...
A (space separated) list of property variables.
See \f[B]\-\-property\-variables\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Simple setup
For most packages it is sufficient to run \f[B]cabal\-docspec\f[R] after
\f[B]cabal v2\-build all\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
cabal v2\-build all
cabal\-docspec
.EE
.SS Testing base library inside GHC source tree
The GHC source tree doesn\(cqt have cabal\-install generated
\f[B]plan.json\f[R], therefore we use \f[B]\-\-no\-cabal\-plan\f[R] and
supply the \f[I]libraries/base/base.cabal\f[R] path.
There are some examples using explanatory comments,
\f[B]\-\-strip\-comments\f[R] makes them work.
Some examples are illustrating non\-termination, therefore short
\f[B]\-\-timeout\f[R] is justified.
Yet, it has to be long enough so the terminating examples have time to
run.
We also set RTS options, reducing the maximum stack to make stack
overflow exceptions occur earlier.
Since the examples below use symbols from the \f[I]mtl\f[R],
\f[I]deepseq\f[R] and \f[I]bytestring\f[R] packages, we make them
available.
Finally, some modules are documented with no\-Prelude assumption,
therefore we have to turn it off.

.EE
.SS The \f[I]lens\f[R] library
The \f[I]lens\f[R] library uses \f[I]simple\-reflect\f[R] library for
illustration of some examples.
However, \f[I]simple\-reflect\f[R] is not a dependency of lens library.
One way to have add such dependency is to create dummy test\-suite with
it.
.IP
.EX
test\-suite doctests
    type:             exitcode\-stdio\-1.0
    main\-is:          doctests.hs
    hs\-source\-dirs:   tests
    default\-language: Haskell2010
    build\-depends:    base, simple\-reflect >= 0.3.1
.EE
.PP
Where \f[B]doctests.hs\f[R] doesn\(cqt need to do anything in
particular, for example it could be:
.IP
.EX
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn \(dqThis test\-suite exists only to add dependencies\(dq
    putStrLn \(dqTo run doctests: \(dq
    putStrLn \(dq    cabal build all \-\-enable\-tests\(dq
    putStrLn \(dq    cabal\-docspec\(dq
.EE
.PP
The bare \f[B]cabal\-docspec\f[R] command works, because needed extra
packages are configured using \f[B]x\-docspec\-extra\-packages\f[R]
field in a package definition library stanza:
.IP
.EX
library
   ...

   x\-docspec\-extra\-packages: simple\-reflect
.EE
.SH WRITING DOCTESTS
\f[B]NOTE:\f[R] This section is edited version of a part of the
\f[I]Doctest\f[R] README.markdown.
cabal\-docspec reuses the way examples are specified.
.PP
Below is a small Haskell module.
The module contains a Haddock comment with some examples of interaction.
The examples demonstrate how the module is supposed to be used.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]module\f[R] Fib \f[B]where\f[R]

\f[I]\-\- | Compute Fibonacci numbers\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- Examples:\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> fib 10\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 55\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> fib 5\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 5\f[R]
fib :: Int \-> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n \- 1) + fib (n \- 2)
.EE
.PP
A comment line starting with \f[CR]>>>\f[R] denotes an
\f[I]expression\f[R].
All comment lines following an expression denote the \f[I]result\f[R] of
that expression.
Result is defined by what a REPL (e.g.\ ghci) prints to
\f[CR]stdout\f[R] and \f[CR]stderr\f[R] when evaluating that expression.
.SS Example groups
Examples from a single Haddock comment are grouped together and share
the same scope.
E.g.
the following works:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> let x = 23\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> x + 42\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 65\f[R]
.EE
.PP
If an example fails, subsequent examples from the same group are
skipped.
E.g.
for
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> let x = 23\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> let n = x + y\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> print n\f[R]
.EE
.PP
\f[CR]print n\f[R] is not tried, because \f[CR]let n = x + y\f[R] fails
(\f[CR]y\f[R] is not in scope!).
.SS A note on performance
Because cabal\-docspec uses compiled library, calling \f[B]:reload:\f[R]
after each group doesn\(cqt cause performance problems.
For that reason, cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt have \f[B]\-\-fast\f[R]
variant, it is not needed.
.SS Setup code
You can put setup code in a \f[I]named chunk\f[R] with the name
\f[B]$setup\f[R].
The setup code is run before each example group.
If the setup code produces any errors/failures, all tests from that
module are skipped.
.PP
Here is an example:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]module\f[R] Foo \f[B]where\f[R]

\f[B]import\f[R] Bar.Baz

\f[I]\-\- $setup\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> let x = 23 :: Int\f[R]

\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> foo + x\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 65\f[R]
foo :: Int
foo = 42
.EE
.SS Multi\-line input
GHCi supports commands which span multiple lines, and the same syntax
works for Doctest:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> :{\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-  let\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-    x = 1\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-    y = 2\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-  in x + y + multiline\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- :}\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 6\f[R]
multiline = 3
.EE
.PP
Note that \f[B]>>>\f[R] can be left off for the lines following the
first: this is so that haddock does not strip leading whitespace.
The expected output has whitespace stripped relative to the
\f[B]:}\f[R].
.PP
Some peculiarities on the ghci side mean that whitespace at the very
start is lost.
This breaks the example \f[I]broken\(ga\f[R] since the x and y aren\(cqt
aligned from ghci\(cqs perspective.
A workaround is to avoid leading space, or add a newline such that the
indentation does not matter:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]{\- | >>> :{\f[R]
\f[I]let x = 1\f[R]
\f[I]    y = 2\f[R]
\f[I]  in x + y + works\f[R]
\f[I]:}\f[R]
\f[I]6\f[R]
\f[I]\-}\f[R]
works = 3

\f[I]{\- | >>> :{\f[R]
\f[I] let x = 1\f[R]
\f[I]     y = 2\f[R]
\f[I]  in x + y + broken\f[R]
\f[I]:}\f[R]
\f[I]3\f[R]
\f[I]\-}\f[R]
broken = 3
.EE
.SS Multi\-line output
If there are no blank lines in the output, multiple lines are handled
automatically.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- | >>> putStr \(dqHello\(rsnWorld!\(dq\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- Hello\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- World!\f[R]
.EE
.PP
If however the output contains blank lines, they must be noted
explicitly with \f[B]\f[R].
For example,
.IP
.EX
\f[B]import\f[R] Data.List ( intercalate )

\f[I]\-\- | Double\-space a paragraph.\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-   Examples:\f[R]

\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
doubleSpace :: String \-> String
doubleSpace = (intercalate \(dq\(rsn\(rsn\(dq) . lines
.EE
.SS Matching arbitrary output
Any lines containing only three dots (\f[B]\&...\f[R]) will match one or
more lines with arbitrary content.
For instance,
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> putStrLn \(dqfoo\(rsnbar\(rsnbaz\(dq\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- foo\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- ...\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- baz\f[R]
.EE
.PP
If a line contains three dots and additional content, the three dots
will match anything \f[I]within that line\f[R]:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> putStrLn \(dqfoo bar baz\(dq\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- foo ... baz\f[R]
.EE
.SS QuickCheck properties
Haddock (since version 2.13.0) has markup support for properties
cabal\-docspec can verify properties with QuickCheck.
Note: this works somewhat differently than it does in Doctest.
.PP
By default properties are not checked.
cabal\-docspec has a simple mechanism to evaluate properties enabled by
\f[B]\-\-check\-properties\f[R].
For it to work, the \f[I]QuickCheck\f[R] package has to be in the
install plan.
.PP
A simple property looks like this:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- prop> \(rsxs \-> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])\f[R]
.EE
.PP
The lambda abstraction is required by default.
cabal\-docspec will quantify over variables passed in with
\f[B]\-\-property\-variables\f[R] command line flag.
.PP
With \f[B]\(enproperty\-variables xs\f[R] the following will work:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- prop> sort xs == (sort . sort) (xs :: [Int])\f[R]
.EE
.PP
Doctest uses a hack to find which variables are free in the the
expression.
cabal\-docspec\(cqs approach is more deterministic, as it doesn\(cqt try
to infer anything.
.PP
Also, in contrast to \f[I]Doctest\f[R], cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt use
the \f[B]polyQuickCheck\f[R] trick.
Therefore some false properties may pass
.IP
.EX
quickCheck $ \(rsxs \-> reverse xs === xs
+++ OK, passed 100 tests.
.EE
.PP
That property passes because the list element type defaults to
\f[B]()\f[R].
To avoid defaulting you may override the default class resolution in a
\f[B]$setup\f[R] block
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- $setup\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> default (Integer, Double)\f[R]
.EE
.PP
Then the property above will fail:
.IP
.EX
quickCheck $ \(rsxs \-> reverse xs === xs
*** Failed! Falsified (after 4 tests and 4 shrinks):    
[1,0]
[0,1] /= [1,0]
.EE
.PP
A complete example that uses setup code is below:
.IP
.EX
\f[B]module\f[R] Fib \f[B]where\f[R]

\f[I]\-\- $setup\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> import Control.Applicative\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> import Test.QuickCheck\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> newtype Small = Small Int deriving Show\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> instance Arbitrary Small where arbitrary = Small . (\(gamod\(ga 10) <$> arbitrary\f[R]

\f[I]\-\- | Compute Fibonacci numbers\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- The following property holds:\f[R]
\f[I]\-\-\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- prop> \(rs(Small n) \-> fib n == fib (n + 2) \- fib (n + 1)\f[R]
fib :: Int \-> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n \- 1) + fib (n \- 2)
.EE
.SS Hiding examples from Haddock
You can put examples into named chunks, and not refer to them in the
export list.
That way they will not be part of the generated Haddock documentation,
but cabal\-docspec will still find them.
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- $\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> 1 + 1\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 2\f[R]
.EE
.SS Using GHC extensions
There\(cqs two sets of GHC extensions involved when running Doctest:
.IP "1." 3
The set of GHC extensions that are active when compiling the module
code.
.IP "2." 3
The set of GHC extensions that are active when executing the Doctest
examples.
(These are not influenced by the LANGUAGE pragmas in the file.)
.PP
Unlike Doctest, cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt compile libraries, therefore
you don\(cqt need to do anything special for the first point.
.PP
The recommended way to enable extensions for cabal\-docspec examples is
to specify them as \f[B]\-X\f[R] flags.
Because set of enabled extensions persist even after \f[B]:reload\f[R],
it is better to embrace that fact and enable them globally.
.PP
Another way to enable extensions, which is compatible with Doctest, is
to switch them on like this:
.IP
.EX
\f[I]\-\- |\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> :set \-XTupleSections\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- >>> fst\(aq $ (1,) 2\f[R]
\f[I]\-\- 1\f[R]
fst\(aq :: (a, b) \-> a
fst\(aq = fst
.EE

.SH KNOWN BUGS AND INFECILITIES
Properties (\f[B]prop>\f[R]) are recognized but not evaluated.
.PP
Literate Haskell is not supported.
.PP
Dependencies\(cq \f[B]install\-includes\f[R] folders are not added to C
preprocess search path.
.PP
GHC\-7.0 relies that \f[I]Char\f[R] type is in scope.
This is an implementation artifact.
.SH Q&A
.SS Q: Why cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt import modules automatically?
cabal\-docspec tests library documentation from the outside.
It doesn\(cqt even try to look into an implementation for some secret
bits, only to find examples.
In this sense it is more principled (than Doctest).
Therefore you might need to repeat imports in a \f[B]$setup\f[R] block.
OTOH, the implementation\(cqs imports never interfere with doctests.
.PP
Named documentaton chunks are the only possibly hidden part of source
text, which cabal\-docspec uses.
.SS Q: How to hide some Prelude imports, e.g.\ null?
One way is to redefine the symbol in a \f[B]$setup\f[R] block using a
qualified module name.
.IP
.EX
\f[B]let\f[R] null = Module.Under.Test.null
.EE
.PP
This way it will shadow both \f[I]Prelude.null\f[R] and
\f[I]Module.Under.Test.null\f[R], and ambiguous symbol errors won\(cqt
appear.
.PP
Another option is to use \f[B]\-XNoImplicitPrelude\f[R] and import
\f[I]Prelude\f[R] explicitly.
.SS Q: How cabal\-docspec works with pre\-8.0 version of GHC?
cabal\-docspec reads a \f[I]plan.json\f[R] file, which is generated by
cabal\-install.
That file contains (almost) all required information for cabal\-docspec
to invoke ghci with the correct arguments.
.SS Q: When does plan.json get generated?
It is generated by cabal\-install as a side\-effect of running the
solver.
For example even
.IP
.EX
cabal build \-\-dry\-run
.EE
.PP
is enough.
However, without libraries actually being built, cabal\-docspec won\(cqt
work.
.SS Q: Does Doctest\(cqs \-\-fast have an equivalent in cabal\-docspec?
No, cabal\-doctest doesn\(cqt need one.
The library code is loaded as pre\-compiled object code, not interpreted
code.
As a result, the \f[CR]:reload\f[R] command doesn\(cqt force code to be
re\-interpreted each time, making to cheap to run.
pre\-compiled object, the \f[B]:reload\f[R] command is cheap.
It doesn\(cqt cause the re\-interpretation of the sources.
.SS Q: Are you envisioning making binary distributions of cabal\-docspec available?
Yes.
.SS Q: In the lens example, is test\-suite somehow related to doctests?
No.\ The test\-suite is there to ensure that the extra dependencies are
built by cabal\-install.
We can also use a dummy package for that purpose, but a test\-suite is
more lightweight.
.PP
As an alternative to this approach, with cabal\-install\-3.4 you may use
.IP
.EX
extra\-packages: simple\-reflect
.EE
.PP
in the \f[I]cabal.project\f[R] file.
.SS Q: Are cabal build \(endisable\-tests and cabal\-docspec incompatible?
In general, no.
As long as the library and extra dependencies used by doctests are
built, cabal\-docspec shold work fine.
.SS Q: What advantages cabal\-docspec have over Doctest and .ghc.environment files?
There are a few differences.
.IP "1." 3
The same cabal\-docspec binary works with all GHC versions.
Also with versions which don\(cqt have .ghc.environment file feature.
.IP "2." 3
cabal\-docspec doesn\(cqt interpret the source code.
Though, Doctest could have that mode too.
.IP "3." 3
Because cabal\-docspec uses \f[I]plan.json\f[R] information, it
doesn\(cqt have problems with the visibility of packages.
For example \f[I]Prelude.Compat\f[R] from \f[I]base\-compat\f[R] and
\f[I]base\-compat\-batteries\f[R] won\(cqt cause ambiguous module
problems, as long as the library being tested itself depends only on
either one.
.SS Q: How to run tests on internal modules?
cabal\-docspec can only test the exported interfaces, so it\(cqs not
possible to test \f[B]other\-modules\f[R].
However, cabal\-docspec does test \f[I]internal\f[R] libraries.
Therefore you can put the internal modules into internal library and
then cabal\-docspec will be able to test them.
